# HoloCube validation

## Single Transmitter box release — October 23, 2026

- HoloCube **0.7 (code 7)**, package `com.developer27.holocube`, installed on Quest 3S.
- The transmitter pipeline now returns at most one detection: the highest-confidence
  valid Transmitter above the selected threshold. If none qualifies, no box is shown.
  The limit is fixed in the pipeline; the old scene field and joystick box-count
  adjustment have been removed. Settings shows **Number of boxes (fixed): 1** and
  still lets the user adjust confidence with the left joystick's left/right axis.
- Unity validation passed with deliberately unsorted candidates: the strongest
  valid transmitter wins, while stronger wrong-class and invalid-box candidates
  are rejected. The no-confident-result case returns no box. Existing coordinates,
  scene wiring, model parity, and negative-input checks also passed.
- Android ARM64/IL2CPP build, recorder packaging, and the single-model packaging
  guard passed. The saved scene was validated again after discarding unrelated
  regeneration-only object-ID changes.
- Independent APK inspection confirmed the checkpoint is unchanged from 0.6 and
  matches the supplied Downloads file byte for byte; startup references also match.
  Model SHA-256: `3da988ae9e3aa5a66b175adb6275463d21f48828faac5ad77ebd0465570e7cf5`.
- Installed with `hzdb app install --replace`, preserving app data. Device package
  information confirms 0.7 / code 7. Cold launch focused the app and passed its
  crash scan. After the user opened HoloCube facing the transmitter, a fresh
  launch confirmed startup model parity and live camera inference. The first
  logged camera worker call took **147 ms**, and the Unity pipeline reported
  exactly one highest-confidence detection with its fixed limit of 1. These
  markers were captured on October 23 at 21:35:44. This is a single worker-call
  timing sample, not sustained FPS or end-to-end display latency.
- A subsequent stereo headset screenshot visually confirms one green box labelled
  **Transmitter 98%** around the transmitter, rendered once in each eye's view.
  The local capture is `Builds/Quest-single-box-overlay.png`.

This cap chooses one candidate per frame; it does not add object tracking or
improve the detector's accuracy. The model limitations documented below still apply.

## Updated Transmitter Recognition release — October 23, 2026

- HoloCube **0.6 (code 6)**, package `com.developer27.holocube`, installed on Quest 3S.
- Replaced the checkpoint with the file supplied in Downloads on October 23.
  Its 10,386,814 bytes are embedded unchanged; its only class is **0: Transmitter**.
- Model SHA-256:
  `3da988ae9e3aa5a66b175adb6275463d21f48828faac5ad77ebd0465570e7cf5`.
- Desktop PyTorch 1.8.1 matches independent Ultralytics 8.4.56 / PyTorch 2.12.0
  inference on bright, angled, and low-light validation frames within 0.001
  confidence and 1 original-image pixel. Blank input, signed RGBA orientation,
  startup-reference mismatch, and modified-checkpoint rejection checks passed.
- Unity scene wiring, decoder/filter checks, and Android ARM64/IL2CPP build passed.
  The original saved scene was validated again after discarding regeneration-only
  object-ID changes. Actual desktop Vulkan preprocessing passed padding,
  orientation, and sRGB checks; its RGBA output also passed model comparison.
- The final build guard and independent APK archive inspection confirmed exactly
  one embedded `.pt`, matching the supplied file byte for byte, and matching
  startup reference files. Recorder packaging checks also passed.
- Installed through `hzdb app install --replace`, preserving existing app data.
  Device package information confirms version 0.6 / code 6. The first cold launch
  focused the app and passed the crash scan. After the user woke the headset and
  opened HoloCube, the on-device startup reference passed and live camera inference
  returned 300 candidate rows in **191 ms**. This is one worker-call sample, not
  sustained FPS or end-to-end display latency. These markers were recorded on
  October 23 at 21:26:35, after the version 0.6 installation.

Headset log markers:

```text
HOLOCUBE_PT_DEVICE_PARITY_PASSED: Transmitter Recognition Model; reference boxes match.

```

APK: `Builds/HoloCube.apk`, 111,053,040 bytes. SHA-256:
`fda6445ab2f68b7f3b3f2e7f05a7f0086e1830fb7ee7ad67e71331de48f307ce`.
Local logs: `Builds/Build.log`, `Builds/Validate.log`, `Builds/ValidateGPU.log`,
`Builds/Validate-300frames-python.log`, `Builds/Validate-300frames-gpu-model.log`,
`Builds/Quest-300frames-app.json`, `Builds/Quest-300frames-launch.json`, and
`Builds/Quest-300frames-live.log`.
Build artifacts and device logs are excluded from Git.

The fixtures come from the validation split of the prepared 300-frame dataset
(210 training / 60 validation / 30 testing images). The supplied model-only
checkpoint contains no training history or accuracy metrics, so this dataset is
recorded as intended context rather than verified training provenance. These are
runtime compatibility checks, not an accuracy benchmark. An additional clipped
close-up validation frame produced no detection above the app's 35% threshold.
Longer headset testing and visual confirmation of the updated detector remain.

## Transmitter Recognition release — October 19, 2026

- HoloCube **0.5 (code 5)**, package `com.developer27.holocube`, deployed to Quest 3S.
- Replaced the general COCO detector with the user-supplied `holocube_transmitter.pt`.
  The checkpoint is embedded unchanged. The only model class is **0: Transmitter**.
- Model SHA-256:
  `8c6e981c7a49ff52c7113cf9cd95763ae6495e3baab3e3d68c17a6919e3d8fef`.
- Desktop PyTorch 1.8.1 matches the independent Ultralytics 8.4.56 / PyTorch 2.12.0
  oracle on three transmitter frames within 0.001 confidence and 1 original-image
  pixel. Blank input, RGBA orientation, startup reference mismatch, and modified
  checkpoint rejection checks also passed.
- Unity scene wiring, single-class decoder/filter checks, and Android ARM64/IL2CPP
  build passed. Moved assets retain their original Unity GUIDs. The existing saved
  scene was validated again after discarding regeneration-only object-ID changes.
- Actual Vulkan GPU preprocessing passed padding, orientation, and sRGB checks;
  its RGBA output produced the expected transmitter box through the new model.
- The final APK guard and a separate archive inspection confirmed exactly one
  embedded `.pt`: the checksum-verified transmitter checkpoint. The cached general
  `yolo26n.pt` is removed during incremental builds. Recorder packaging checks passed.
- Installed with `hzdb app install --replace`, preserving app data. Cold launch
  focused the app and passed the crash scan. The on-device startup reference passed,
  and a live camera frame returned 300 candidate rows in **157 ms**. This is one
  worker-call sample, not sustained FPS or end-to-end display latency.
- **The user confirmed a box labelled “Transmitter” appears around the transmitter
  in the Quest 3S headset.**

Headset log markers:

```text
HOLOCUBE_PT_DEVICE_PARITY_PASSED: Transmitter Recognition Model; reference boxes match.
HOLOCUBE_PT_READY: Transmitter Recognition Model loaded on device; class 0: Transmitter
HOLOCUBE_PT_CAMERA_FRAME: 300 detection rows in 157 ms
```

APK: `Builds/HoloCube.apk`, 111,063,016 bytes. SHA-256:
`ee604a527600c11731ddcb3b280d3beac7835f09ae2c23c80d2c1c83c6c2fd72`.
Local logs: `Builds/Build.log`, `Builds/Validate.log`, `Builds/ValidateGPU.log`,
`Builds/Quest-transmitter.log`. Build artifacts and logs are excluded from Git.

The three reference images come from the dataset source recording and may overlap
training. These checks establish runtime compatibility and a successful live use,
not a held-out accuracy benchmark. Generalization to other lighting, viewpoints,
transmitter variants, multiple transmitters, and sustained thermal behavior remains
unmeasured. Detection provides boxes and class labels, not optical data decoding.

# Historical general-detector validation

Verified on October 4, 2026.

Current builds use Android app ID `com.developer27.holocube`. The historical
checks below used the earlier package ID and artifacts recorded here.

## Model and app

- App: HoloCube 0.4 (code 4), package `com.holocube.questyolo`.
- Model: original Ultralytics `yolo26n.pt`; no ONNX, TorchScript, or other model export.
- Checkpoint SHA-256: `9b09cc8bf347f0fc8a5f7657480587f25db09b34bf33b0652110fb03a8ad4fef`.
- The checkpoint extracted from the APK's embedded Python archive has the exact
  same SHA-256 as the original downloaded file.
- Embedded runtime: Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.8.1, NumPy 1.19.5, Chaquopy 16.1.0.
- Input `[1,3,320,320]` RGB floats in `[0,1]`; output `[1,300,6]` end-to-end rows.
- Export-free loading uses inference-only layer methods adapted from Ultralytics
  8.4.56 for this exact checkpoint. Arbitrary checkpoints are not supported.

## Passed on the development computer

- Unity 6000.0.66f2 compilation and Android ARM64/IL2CPP/Vulkan APK build.
- Scene wiring, original checkpoint hash, 80 labels, and shader references.
- Letterbox coordinate mapping; confidence/class checks; detection limits;
  invalid-value and incompatible-output rejection; no second NMS pass.
- Direct PyTorch 1.8.1 inference from the unchanged checkpoint produces four
  people and one bus, matching the independent PyTorch 2.12.0 fixture within
  0.001 confidence and 1 original-image pixel.
- Actual Vulkan GPU image preparation on the desktop NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti passes
  padding, orientation, sRGB, and RGBA-readback checks.
- Those real Unity RGBA pixels also produce four people and one bus through
  the new Python preprocessing and direct checkpoint inference.
- APK inspection confirms the original `.pt` and reference fixture are embedded
  in `assets/chaquopy/app.imy`, with no exported model in that Python archive.

## Passed on the connected Quest

- Installed the APK over the existing app while preserving its data.
- Cold launch completed with no crash reported by the Quest launch verifier.
- Embedded Python/PyTorch loaded the original checkpoint on the headset.
- The startup reference check passed on the headset: five detections match the
  independent fixture's class IDs, confidence scores, and box coordinates.
- The live camera path returned 300 detection rows from a captured frame.
- The first logged camera-frame worker call took **155 ms**. This is one sample
  including Python input/output handling, not sustained FPS or total AR latency.

Headset log markers:

```text
HOLOCUBE_PT_DEVICE_PARITY_PASSED: original checkpoint; five reference detections match.
HOLOCUBE_PT_READY: original YOLO26n checkpoint loaded on device
HOLOCUBE_PT_CAMERA_FRAME: 300 detection rows in 155 ms
```

## Remaining checks

Visual stereo-overlay alignment, repeated pause/resume cycles, sustained frame
rate, memory use, and thermal behavior still need longer headset testing.
The runtime uses older Python/PyTorch packages to enable direct `.pt` loading;
desktop and initial headset success do not establish compatibility with every
future Horizon OS version or arbitrary trained YOLO checkpoints.

## Local artifacts

Builds and logs are excluded from Git. Reproduce them using the Unity menu or
`Tools/run-unity.sh` after running `Tools/setup-python.sh`.

## Recording feedback update — October 5, 2026

- Rebuilt from the complete repository. The previously deployed APK lacked the
  native `QuestCameraVideoRecorder` class, even though its source was in Git.
- Android build guards now require the recorder source, independent recording
  and save-feedback canvases, the red circle renderer, and the recorder class
  in the completed APK/AAB's DEX files.
- The final build passed the existing scene/model validation and Android build
  guards. Log: `Builds/Build-final.log`.
- Installed on the connected Quest 3S with app data preserved. Cold launch
  completed, the app was foreground, and the launch verifier found no crash.
- After launch, four new B-button recordings completed on the Quest. Device
  logs reported `HOLOCUBE_VIDEO_STARTED`, `HOLOCUBE_VIDEO_SAVING`, and
  `HOLOCUBE_VIDEO_SAVED` for each, including the 34-frame
  `Movies/HoloCube/HoloCube_20261005_182656_785.mp4`. All four files were present
  in the headset's Movies/HoloCube folder.
- Device model parity also passed, and live camera inference returned 300
  detection rows. Log: `Builds/Quest-final.log`.
- The user confirmed the red recording badge and saved-file message now work
  in the headset. The inference-off timer is set to three seconds; a separate
  visual timing check was not reported.
- Final APK SHA-256:
  `4b12f0f8f26d9af11d023418022abb5e3d59acb2d0e45031b2102b486b910505`.
